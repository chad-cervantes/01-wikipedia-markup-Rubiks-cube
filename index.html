  <h1>Rubik's Cube</h1>
  <p>The Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle originally invented in 1974[2][3] by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture <em>Ernő Rubik</em>. 
  <p>Originally called the Magic Cube,[4] the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Pentangle Puzzles in the UK in 1978,[5] and then by Ideal Toy Corp in 1980[6] via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer.[7] The cube was released internationally in 1980 and became one of the most recognized icons in popular culture. It won the 1980 German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle. As of March 2021, over 450 million cubes had been sold worldwide,[8][9][needs update] making it the world's bestselling puzzle game[10][11] and bestselling toy.[12] </p>
  <p>The Rubik's Cube was inducted into the US National Toy Hall of Fame in 2014.[13]</p>
  <h2>Solutions</h2>
  <h3>Singmaster notation</h3>
  <p>Many 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube enthusiasts use a notation developed by David Singmaster to denote a sequence of moves, referred to as "Singmaster notation".[57] Its relative nature allows algorithms to be written in such a way that they can be applied regardless of which side is designated the top or how the colours are organised on a particular cube.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>F (Front): the side currently facing the solver</li>
      <li>B (Back): the side opposite the front</li>
      <li>U (Up): the side above or on top of the front side</li>
      <li>D (Down): the side opposite the top, underneath the Cube</li>
      <li>L (Left): the side directly to the left of the front</li>
      <li>R (Right): the side directly to the right of the front</li>
      <li>R (Right): the side directly to the right of the front</li>
      <li>f (Front two layers): the side facing the solver and the corresponding middle layer</li>
      <li>b (Back two layers): the side opposite the front and the corresponding middle layer</li>
      <li>u (Up two layers): the top side and the corresponding middle layer</li>
      <li>d (Down two layers): the bottom layer and the corresponding middle layer</li>
      <li>l (Left two layers): the side to the left of the front and the corresponding middle layer</li>
      <li>r (Right two layers): the side to the right of the front and the corresponding middle layer</li>
      <li>x (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on R</li>
      <li>y (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on U</li>
      <li>z (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on F</li>
    </ul>
